## How to use:
- We need a .txt template that has variables that begins with ǂ, ƺ or ȡ.  
This to avoid conflicts using punctuation marks.
E.g.
```
Hello ǂname

Nice to meet you! :D

ǂme.
```
- Run: `python main.py text`
- Provide requested values.  
- This will generate a new file with the suffix *_replaced* in the same folder.  

```
$ python main.py
🚀🚀  Welcome to eztemplate!  🚀🚀
File path: test.txt
Special character (ǂ, ƺ, ȡ): ǂ
New value(s) separated by comas(,) if applies: Joe,Siri
🚀🚀 Your file has been exported! 🚀🚀
```
test_new.txt
```
Hello Joe

Nice to meet you! :D

Siri.
```

Also we can do the same thing in a short way
Eg.
```
$ python main.py text -f test.txt -c ǂ -v "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Niñita"
🚀🚀 Your file has been exported! 🚀🚀
```
Result:
```
Hello Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

Nice to meet you! :D

Niñita.
```
