## How to use:
- We need a .txt template that has variables that begins with Ç‚, Æº or È¡.
This to avoid conflicts using punctuation marks.
E.g.
```
Hello Ç‚name

Nice to meet you! :D

Ç‚me.
```
- Run: `python main.py text`
- Provide requested values.
- This will generate a new file with the suffix *_replaced* in the same folder.

```
$ python main.py text
ğŸš€ğŸš€  Welcome to eztemplate!  ğŸš€ğŸš€
File path: test.txt
Special character (Ç‚, Æº, È¡): Ç‚
New value(s) separated by comas(,) if applies: Joe,Siri
ğŸš€ğŸš€ Your file has been exported! ğŸš€ğŸš€
```
test_new.txt
```
Hello Joe

Nice to meet you! :D

Siri.
```

Also we can do the same thing in a short way
Eg.
```
$ python main.py text -f test.txt -c Ç‚ -v "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, NiÃ±ita"
ğŸš€ğŸš€ Your file has been exported! ğŸš€ğŸš€
```
Result:
```
Hello Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

Nice to meet you! :D

NiÃ±ita.
```
